# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis (UK)
##  Overview
  This project dives into a two-year dataset of UK road accidents to uncover patterns and insights that can help improve road safety. Through data visualization, geospatial mapping, and contextual enrichment       (like weather and lighting conditions), the goal is to explore not just what’s happening — but why.

  “Road safety is not just a national issue — it’s a human one.”

##  Project Contents
- Temporal Factors
    Analysis of accident patterns across hours of the day, days of the week, and seasons, with a focus on fatality and severity trends over time.

- Environmental Conditions
    Evaluation of how weather (e.g., fog, rain, wind) and lighting (daylight, darkness, streetlights) influence accident severity and frequency.

- Road Design & Infrastructure
    Examination of road types (e.g., roundabouts, dual carriageways) and the top accident-prone locations, identifying infrastructure elements linked to high accident rates.

- Visibility Conditions
    Assessment of the role of visibility—particularly in foggy or poorly lit environments—and its interaction with road and traffic types in increasing risk.

##  Key Insights
- Most Accidents ≠ Most Severe: Accidents peak during rush hours, but the deadliest crashes often occur at night or during early quiet hours.

- Roundabouts Are Hotspots: All top 5 locations with >13 accidents were roundabouts, suggesting design or behavioral challenges at these intersections.

- Winter Is Riskier: Fatality rates spike in February, indicating dangerous driving conditions (e.g., icy roads, low visibility).

- Fog Increases Risk: Foggy conditions significantly raise average accident severity, especially on slip roads and dual carriageways.

- Low Visibility Amplifies Danger: Accidents that occur in darkness without street lighting or in foggy conditions tend to be more severe, showing that poor visibility is a critical factor in accident severity.

##  Applicability
  Although this analysis is based on UK road data, the patterns and safety implications are relevant globally. The behaviors observed — such as speed, visibility, and traffic flow — transcend borders, making the   insights actionable for any country aiming to enhance road safety.
